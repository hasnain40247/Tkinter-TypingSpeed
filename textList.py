    "Dave wasn't exactly sure how he had ended up in this predicament. He ran through all the events that had lead to "
    "this current situation and it still didn't make sense. He wanted to spend some time to try and make sense of it "
    "all, but he had higher priorities at the moment. The first was how to get out of his current situation of being "
    "naked in a tree with snow falling all around and no way for him to get down "
    ,
    "He was aware there were numerous wonders of this world including the unexplained creations of humankind that "
    "showed the wonder of our ingenuity. There are huge heads on Easter Island. There are the Egyptian pyramids. "
    "Thereâ€™s Stonehenge. But he now stood in front of a newly discovered monument that simply didn't make any sense "
    "and he wondered how he was ever going to be able to explain it.",
    "He heard the song coming from a distance, lightly floating over the air to his ears. Although it was soft and "
    "calming, he was wary. It seemed a little too soft and a little too calming for everything that was going on. He "
    "wanted it to be nothing more than beautiful music coming from the innocent and pure joy of singing, but in the "
    "back of his mind, he knew it was likely some type of trap.",
    "It had become a far too common an event in her life. She has specifically placed the key to the box in a special "
    "place so that she wouldn't lose it and know exactly where it was when the key was needed. Now that she needed to "
    "open the box, she had absolutely no idea where that special spot she placed the key might be.",
    """"It doesn't take much to touch someone's heart," Daisy said with a smile on her face. "It's often just the 
    little things you do that can change a person's day for the better." Daisy truly believed this to be the way the 
    world worked, but she didn't understand that she was merely a robot that had been programmed to believe this.""",
    "It all started with the computer. Had he known what was to follow, he would have never logged on that day. But "
    "the truth was there was no way to know what was about to happen. So Dave pressed the start button, the computer "
    "booted up, the screen came alive, and everything Dave knew to be true no longer was. "

    "The shades were closed keeping the room dark. Peter knew that he should open them and let in the sunlight so he "
    "could begin the day, but he didn't have the energy or willpower. Nothing had gone as expected the day before and "
    "he no longer wanted to spend the energy to begin a new day. He stared at the shades wondering if there was a way "
    "to disappear from the reality of the world for the rest of the day. "
    ,
    "No matter how hard he tried, he couldn't give her a good explanation about what had happened. It didn't even "
    "really make sense to him. All he knew was that he froze at the moment and no matter how hard he tried to react, "
    "nothing in his body allowed him to move. It was as if he had instantly become a statue and although he could see "
    "what was taking place, he couldn't move to intervene. He knew that wasn't a satisfactory explanation even though "
    "it was the truth.",
    "It really shouldn't have mattered to Betty. That's what she kept trying to convince herself even if she knew it "
    "mattered to Betty more than practically anything else. Why was she trying to convince herself otherwise? As she "
    "stepped forward to knock on Betty's door, she still didn't have a convincing answer to this question that she'd "
    "been asking herself for more than two years now.",
    "Betty decided to write a short story and she was sure it was going to be amazing. She had already written it in "
    "her "
    "head and each time she thought about it she grinned from ear to ear knowing how wonderful it would be. She could "
    "imagine the accolades coming in and the praise she would receive for creating such a wonderful piece. She was "
    "therefore extremely frustrated when she actually sat down to write the short story and the story that was so "
    "beautiful inside her head refused to come out that way on paper. "
